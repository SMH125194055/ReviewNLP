# üé• Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

This project focuses on analyzing movie reviews and classifying them into three categories:  
üíö **Positive** | üñ§ **Neutral** | ‚ù§Ô∏è **Negative**  

Since pre-trained models often lack data for neutral sentiment, we developed a custom pipeline using polarity scores for sentiment labeling. Below is an overview of the process:

## üöÄ Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Integration**  
üìÇ Reviews were gathered from multiple files (e.g., 2016, 2018, etc.).  
üìã All reviews were combined into a single dataset and saved for further processing.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning**  
üßπ The dataset was cleaned to remove unnecessary noise, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Label Assignment**  
‚úçÔ∏è Since the data lacked predefined labels, we assigned them using **polarity scores**:  
- üíö **Positive**: Polarity > Threshold  
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Negative**: Polarity < -Threshold  
- üñ§ **Neutral**: Polarity within the threshold range  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling Class Imbalance**  
‚öñÔ∏è The dataset was imbalanced, with **positive reviews** dominating while **neutral** and **negative** reviews were sparse.  
To resolve this, we applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to balance the class distribution, ensuring fairness and avoiding bias in the models.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training**  
üìä Multiple machine learning models were trained to classify the reviews, including:  
- ü§ñ **Naive Bayes**  
- üß† **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- üöÄ **Gradient Boosting**  
- üõ†Ô∏è Other classifiers  

‚úÖ The trained models were saved in `.pkl` format for easy integration with the frontend.

## ‚ú® Features

üéØ **Custom Sentiment Labeling**  
- Reviews are labeled based on polarity scores, enabling neutral sentiment categorization.  

üìä **Balanced Dataset**  
- SMOTE ensures all sentiment classes are equally represented.  

ü§ù **Diverse Models**  
- Provides flexibility with multiple pre-trained models to suit different needs.
